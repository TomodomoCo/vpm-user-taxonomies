# VPM User Taxonomies

VPM User Taxonomies is a fork of Peter Shaw's [LH User Taxonomies](https://github.com/shawfactor/lh-user-taxonomies), which is itself a fork of a plugin by Damian Gostomskis, and was also inspired by [work by Justin Tadlock](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2011/10/20/custom-user-taxonomies-in-wordpress).

VPM User Taxonomies aims to provide a clean, minimal implementation of user taxonomies, along with an interface for managing user taxonomies inside the WordPress admin.

Specifically, this implementation of taxonomies aims to achieve feature and experience-parity between user taxonomies and traditional post taxonomies.

Pull requests are welcome!
